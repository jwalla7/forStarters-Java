# ADTs
Abstract Data Types are also known as ADTs. Two types of ADTs include Stacks and Queues.  
## Queues
FIFO Model - (First In, First Out)
## Priority Queues

## Deques

## Stacks
LIFO Model - (Last In, First Out)
<p>
Stacks are Linear ADTs. They can be implemented with or backed by various data structures such as Arrays or some type of LinkedList.
